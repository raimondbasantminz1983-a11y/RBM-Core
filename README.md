RBM (Rule-Based Mind) is not a programming language.
It is a rule-first, ethics-focused system model
for human and AI decision-making.

Core Principle:
Observation → Rule → Ethics → Control → Result

RBM ensures that no action is executed
without passing ethical and control validation.
RBM is a universal rule-based decision framework designed to guide both human and AI actions with ethics, control, and accountability at its core.
# RBM Specification (RBM-SPEC)

## Overview
RBM (Rule-Based Mind) is an ethics-first, rule-driven decision framework designed for both human and AI systems.  
This specification defines the internal logic, layers, and execution constraints of RBM.

RBM does not execute actions directly.  
It validates intent, ethics, and control before allowing any execution.

---

## Core Objective
To ensure that no decision or action—human or artificial—is performed without passing structured ethical and control validation.

---

## RBM Core Flow
Observation → Rule → Ethics → Control → Result

Each stage is mandatory.  
Skipping any stage invalidates the decision.

---

## RBM Layers

### Layer 1: Observation
- Collects facts, signals, and context
- No assumptions or emotions
- Pure input layer

### Layer 2: Rule
- Applies predefined rules or logic
- Determines whether the observation qualifies for action
- Rules must be explicit and auditable

### Layer 3: Ethics
- Evaluates moral, social, and human impact
- Prevents harm, injustice, or unethical outcomes
- Ethics layer has override authority

### Layer 4: Control
- Verifies permissions, limits, and safeguards
- Ensures accountability and traceability
- Prevents uncontrolled execution

### Layer 5: Result
- Action is allowed or denied
- Result is logged and reviewable

---

## Execution Principle
RBM follows a strict rule:

"If ethics or control validation fails, execution is denied."

---

## Scope
RBM can be applied to:
- Human decision-making systems
- AI and autonomous systems
- Governance and policy logic
- Security and control frameworks

RBM is independent of any programming language or technology stack.
