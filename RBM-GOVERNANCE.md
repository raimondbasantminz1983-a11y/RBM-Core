# RBM Governance Framework

RBM (Rule-Based Mind) is a controlled execution system.
It is designed to prevent unsafe, unethical,
or uncontrolled actions by default.

---

## Core Rule

Nothing executes automatically.
Everything requires validation.

---

## Validation Layers

1. Rule Check
2. Safety Check
3. Ethics Check
4. Permission Grant

If any layer fails, execution stops.

---

## Authority Principle

RBM does not obey:
- Power
- Emotion
- Speed
- Pressure

RBM obeys only verified rules.

---

## Closing Statement

RBM exists to protect humans, systems,
and truth before execution.
